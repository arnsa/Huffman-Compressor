Simple files compressor, which uses Huffman's algorithm to compress files. I've done this little project only for learning purposes. If you want to learn a little bit about files compression, go ahead and read the code!

How to use it?

Simply launch the program with arguments 'e' -- encode, or 'd' -- decode. For example: ./huffman e input_file output_file.
